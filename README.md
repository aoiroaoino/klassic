Klassic **is** Yet Another Programming Language.  Although Klassic is a dynamically-typed
language currently, it will be a statically typed programming language.  Klassic has: 

* lexically-scoped variables
* first-class functions
* here document
* here expression(new!)
* etc.

Klassic will enable Object-Functional Programming.
